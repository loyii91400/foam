# Sprint Planning 1

- Story orders are affected by:
  - Their coupling with other stories, those which relies on other stories comes after
  - Their ease of finishing, easier tasks could be done first, as it fulfils the Product owner's values

When ordering stories, think about how it affects different stakeholders, i.e. the product owner's expectations when it comes to easier tasks.

- Going through each story can lead to going back to a previous story to provide suppliment material.
- It could also lead to rearranging the stories as some points of interest may have been missed before
