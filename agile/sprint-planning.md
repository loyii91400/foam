# Sprint Planning 1

- Story orders are affected by:
  - Their coupling with other stories, those which relies on other stories comes after
  - Their ease of finishing, easier tasks could be done first, as it fulfils the Product owner's values

When ordering stories, think about how it affects different stakeholders, i.e. the product owner's expectations when it comes to easier tasks.

- Going through each story can lead to going back to a previous story to provide suppliment material.
- It could also lead to rearranging the stories as some points of interest may have been missed before

# Sprint Planning 2

- It is necessary to discuss in more detail about how to achieve each task during the development process.
- Don't miss out on tiny details like creating a menu which you may miss.
- After creating all the tasks for a story, go through them to see if all of them can be done by the development team. If not, the task may be blocked and require further actions to be done.

sidenote: This meeting seems very technical and may require a lot of experience (whether it's from previously working on the project for it's structure, or generally on what to do during the development) to know what exactly you need to finish a task.
